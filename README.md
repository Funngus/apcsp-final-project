# APCSP Final Project

Students will choose ONE of the following project options:

## Guided projects

Learn how to build a digital program, then design and build your own. All lessons and projects are on CODE.ORG.

- Web site
  - You’ll learn how to create and share the content on your own web pages. After deciding what content you want to share with the world, you’ll learn how to structure and style your pages using HTML and CSS. You’ll also practice valuable programming skills such as debugging, using resources, and teamwork.
  - Recommended for students who want to build a web presence, such as a portfolio, shared experience, or personal passion.
- Game
  - You’ll build on your coding experience as you program animations, interactive art, and games in Game Lab. The unit starts off with simple shapes and builds up to more sophisticated sprite-based games, using the same programming concepts and the design process computer scientists use daily. In the final project, you’ll develop a personalized, interactive program.
  - Recommended for students who love gaming.
- Machine Learning
  - A hands-on introduction to developing a machine learning model with tabular data. Students explore how computers learn from data to make decisions, then develop machine learning projects around real-world data. The unit culminates in designing a machine learning app to solve a personally relevant problem.
  - Recommended for students who want to build concrete programming skills.

## Open-Source Project

Design your own digital project and publish it for others to build on.

- Develop a project plan from design to production.
- Could be any digital product including…
  - Web or mobile app
  - Command line program
  - Library
  - Plugin for existing software
- Write a program in the language of your choice – Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.
- Maintain and publish your project code on Github as a public open-source repository.
