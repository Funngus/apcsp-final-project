Night Terror

Waking up in extreme dread,
darkness shines bright, and blind my eyes.
Nailed on the bed, I was,
screaming voiceless.

Hovering and hovering, the shadow, 
above the burning bed,
inside my aching head,
then into the void.

Gone, it is, 
yet fear remains.
Will it come back? Not so sure.
So I keep myself awake, 
In case the illusion wasnâ€™t fake.
