Narcolepsy

by Charlie Xu

The sun hung in the sky
Glaring through the air
(Bright, arrogant, and
Perhaps wicked)
Spur on every creature under,
To continue their laborious life.

With the immense glory,
He blocks the sky.
Stars escaped from his rule, 
And moon yield under.

Perhaps when the sun perished,
When full moon hung
We shall be daytime sleeper.
